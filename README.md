World building a science fantasy universe

This setting book will to evolve a vision for a Science-Fiction/Fantasy
universe that has been lingering at the back of my head for a while. Here I am
foremost focusing on worldbuilding, trying to write a manifesto that captures
the essence of this setting. In doing so, I am trying not to stray too much
into unimportant details -- the scope of this world will be huge and complex,
way larger than a single person could ever fill with life.
It might well be, that due to the scope of this setting, the characters and
places of one story or game round might never meet or even be knowable to those
of another. Rather than trying the tantalizing task of constructing a perfectly
consistent world and history full of unarguable details, I will only sketch a
rough background of world and history -- as subjective and incomplete as the
world we live in.
This background is more supposed to convey specific moods and emotions, motives
and ideas. In doing so, I hope to give some coherence to all stories happening
in this setting on a more abstract level.

To get a first grasp on the ideas and moods I am trying to convey, let me list
some of these:

* The universe is vast and indifferent to mankind ... even while mankind
conquers the stars.
* Mankind itself is vastly complex in all the ways culture and the human
psyche evolved ... across time as well as space.
* History repeats itself, and the basic conflicts, cravings and fears of man
stay the same.
* There will be no Utopia to end mankind's struggles -- We will always face
challenges.
* There is no real progress -- At most change and diversification.
* Nature will always hold mystery, however far we evolve.
* Advanced technology holds the same kind of mystery to those who do not
understand it.

More inside the book - but be warned, it's all in a very early experimental phase.
